Hi there ðŸ‘‹
=====
I'm Fahim Anjum, a postdoctoral researcher at UCSF passionate about machine learning, particularly in brain signal processing and large language models (LLMs).
I'm Fahim Anjum, a postdoctoral researcher at UCSF passionate about machine learning, particularly in brain signal processing and large language models (LLMs).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing innovative deep-learning models for classifying and interpreting brain signals, with a focus on neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about scalable architectures in LLMs and their application in healthcare.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that intersect machine learning, neuroscience, and healthcare.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m actively seeking job opportunities where I can apply my expertise in machine learning and brain signal processing.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about machine learning, deep learning architectures, or how to get started with EEG signal processing.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m fascinated by the parallels between neural networks and the human brain â€“ itâ€™s what drives my research every day!

About Me
====
I hold a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Iowa, where I specialized in decoding brain signals (EEG, LFP) in Parkinsonâ€™s disease and analyzing neural pathways using Control theory. My research led to innovative features for accurate brain decoding, with a patent pending on Parkinsonâ€™s diagnosis via EEG data. I was honored to receive the Graduate College Post-comprehensive Research Fellowship and was featured in the â€˜Dare to Discover Campaignâ€™ for my work.

Currently, Iâ€™m a postdoctoral scholar at Little Lab, UCSF, where I focus on developing adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation to restore normal sleep patterns in Parkinsonâ€™s patients. In 2021, I received the Computational Innovator Fellowship Grant from UCSF.

**Expertise:** Brain signal decoding, signal processing, computational models, machine learning, and control theory.

**Hobbies:** Playing musical instruments, reading, skiing, and pc gaming.
