Hi there ðŸ‘‹
----
I'm Fahim Anjum, a postdoctoral researcher at UCSF passionate about machine learning, particularly in brain signal processing and large language models (LLMs). I have 9+ years of experience in designing ML algorithms, statistical models, and efficient features for time-series analysis, forecasting, and classification


ðŸ”­ Developing deep-learning models for brain signal classification.

ðŸŒ± Exploring scalable architectures in LLMs for healthcare applications.

ðŸ‘¯ Open to collaborations at the intersection of machine learning, neuroscience, and healthcare.

ðŸ¤” Actively seeking job opportunities in machine learning and brain signal processing.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about machine learning, deep learning, or EEG signal processing.

ðŸ“« Reach me at [dr.fahim.anjum@gmail.com](mailto:dr.fahim.anjum@gmail.com)

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Fahim

âš¡ Fun fact: Iâ€™m fascinated by the parallels between neural networks and the human brain!

<h1 id="aboutme">About Me</h1>

<h2>Education</h2>
I hold a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Iowa, where I specialized in decoding brain signals (EEG, LFP) in Parkinsonâ€™s disease and analyzing neural pathways using Control theory. My research led to innovative features for accurate brain decoding, with a patent pending on Parkinsonâ€™s diagnosis via EEG data. I was honored to receive the Graduate College Post-comprehensive Research Fellowship and was featured in the â€˜Dare to Discover Campaignâ€™ for my work.

Currently, Iâ€™m a postdoctoral scholar at Little Lab, UCSF, where I focus on developing adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation to restore normal sleep patterns in Parkinsonâ€™s patients. In 2021, I received the Computational Innovator Fellowship Grant from UCSF.

<h2>Expertise</h2> 
Brain signal decoding, signal processing, computational models, machine learning, and control theory, LLM, Statistical models

<h2>Hobbies</h2> 
Playing musical instruments, reading, skiing, and PC gaming.
