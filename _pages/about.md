<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Education</h2>
I hold a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Iowa, where I specialized in decoding brain signals (EEG, LFP) in Parkinsonâ€™s disease and analyzing neural pathways using Control theory. My research led to innovative features for accurate brain decoding, with a patent pending on Parkinsonâ€™s diagnosis via EEG data. I was honored to receive the Graduate College Post-comprehensive Research Fellowship and was featured in the â€˜Dare to Discover Campaignâ€™ for my work.

Currently, Iâ€™m a postdoctoral scholar at Little Lab, UCSF, where I focus on developing adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation to restore normal sleep patterns in Parkinsonâ€™s patients. In 2021, I received the Computational Innovator Fellowship Grant from UCSF.

<h2>Expertise</h2> 
Brain signal decoding, signal processing, computational models, machine learning, and control theory, LLM, Statistical models

<h2>Hobbies</h2> 
Playing musical instruments, reading, skiing, and PC gaming.
